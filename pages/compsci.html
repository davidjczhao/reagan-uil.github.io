        <p>Computer Science challenges students to study a broad range of areas in computer science, 
          to gain an understanding of the significance of computation as well as the details of programming, 
          to be alert to new technology and information in computer science, to gain an understanding of the basic principles 
          as well as knowledge of the history and philosophy of computer science and to foster a sense of enthusiasm about computer science.</p>
        <p>We do multiple-choice computer science questions in Java and code solutions to problems.</p>

        <p>The Journalism program is not so much to train students to become professional journalists but rather to stress writing and higher order thinking skills.</p>
        <p>Feature Writing teaches students to read critically, to digest and prioritize information quickly, and to write clearly, accurately, and succinctly. Emphasis is placed on the same writing skills as other UIL Journalism Contests, as well as the ability to write descriptively.</p>
        <p>News Writing teaches students to read critically, to digest and prioritize information quickly and to write clearly, accurately and succinctly. Emphasis is placed on mechanical and stylistic precision, lead writing, use of direct and indirect quotes	and news judgment.</p>
        <p>Editorial Writing teaches students to read critically, to digest and prioritize information quickly and to write clearly, accurately, and succinctly. Emphasis is placed on mechanical and stylistic precision, news judgment, and the ability to think deeply, to compare and contrast and to argue or defend a point of view persuasively.</p>
        <p>Headline Writing teaches students to	read critically, to digest and prioritize information quickly and to write clearly, accurately and succinctly. Emphasis is placed on the ability to discern key facts and to write with flair and style in order to tell and sell a story.	</p>
        <p>Copy Editing teaches students the vital skills of proofreading and editing to create accurate, clear and succinct writing. Emphasis is placed on the ability to find and correct grammatical, spelling, punctuation, AP style and factual errors.</p>
